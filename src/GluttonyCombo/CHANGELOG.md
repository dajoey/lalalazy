# Gluttony Combo â€” Changelog

## v1.0.4.15 (2026-05-18)

### Fixed
- **Install/Update failure (CRITICAL)**: `pluginmaster.json` advertised AssemblyVersion 1.0.4.14 but the bundled `GluttonyCombo.json` inside `latest.zip` reported 1.0.4.12 - the csproj `<Version>` was never bumped in v1.0.4.13 / v1.0.4.14. Dalamud rejected the install with a manifest mismatch and silently uninstalled the plugin on attempted update. csproj `<Version>` is now `1.0.4.15` and `pluginmaster.json` matches.
- **AutoDuty IPC integration (was a no-op)**: `Services/IPC_Subscriber/AutoDuty.cs` subscribed to `AutoDuty.isRunning` / `AutoDuty.isPaused` / `AutoDuty.currentState` - none of which AutoDuty exports. Every call threw, `SafeInvoke` swallowed the error, `ShouldYield` was `false` forever, and the targeting-loop fix from v1.0.4.13 never actually engaged. Rewritten using the project's `ReusableIPC` pattern with the correct PascalCase IPC names (`AutoDuty.IsStopped`, `AutoDuty.IsNavigating`); `ShouldYield` is now `IsEnabled && !IsStopped` so Gluttony yields rotation + targeting whenever AutoDuty has the wheel.
- **Hold-to-Repeat runaway**: the v1.0.4.13 gate was `TimeSinceLastAction < 1500ms`, which would self-perpetuate (each plugin re-fire resets the timer) and could spam an action indefinitely. Tightened the window to 400ms and added a 2600ms self-cooldown so at most one assist fire per GCD cycle, with hard stop the moment the user stops feeding fresh button presses.

### Notes
- Hold-to-Repeat remains disabled by default and is still time-based; a future revision will hook `UseActionDetour` for true button-state detection.

## v1.0.4.14 (2026-05-18)

### Added
- **Hold to Repeat**: New toggleable option (Main UI Options > Hold to Repeat) that continuously fires your last combo-replaced action while you hold the hotbar button. Automatically respects GCD, animation lock, and casting state. Stops immediately when you release the button.

## v1.0.4.13 (2026-05-18)

### Fixed
- **AutoDuty IPC Integration**: Added AutoDuty IPC subscriber to detect when AutoDuty has paused for mechanics (Pyretic, Untarget, etc.). Gluttony now yields autorotation and target acquisition when AutoDuty is in control, preventing the targeting loop where AutoDuty clears the target and Gluttony immediately retargets.
  - New file: `GluttonyCombo/Services/IPC_Subscriber/AutoDuty.cs`
  - Patched: `GluttonyCombo/GluttonyCombo.cs` â€” initializes and disposes AutoDuty IPC
  - Patched: `GluttonyCombo/AutoRotation/AutoRotationController.cs` â€” checks `AutoDutyIPC.ShouldYield` in `ShouldSkipAutorotation()`
