# Gluttony Combo Ã¢â‚¬â€ Changelog

## v1.0.4.16 (2026-05-18)

### Changed
- **Hold-to-Repeat re-implemented as event-driven button-state detection.** The v1.0.4.15 version still used `TimeSinceLastAction` as a proxy for "button still held," which was fragile in practice. The new implementation subscribes to `ActionWatching.OnActionSend` and uses the game itself as the held-button oracle: while the user holds a hotbar button, the game's input layer queues an auto-fire at each GCD which keeps our press tracker fresh; when the user releases, the game stops queueing and the tracker goes stale within 350ms. A short self-fire suppression window (80ms) prevents our own `UseAction` call from feeding back into the tracker and looping forever. Removed the v1.0.4.15 self-cooldown gate (no longer needed).
- **Subscribe/unsubscribe wiring**: `ActionWatching.OnActionSend += HoldToRepeat_OnActionSend` added next to the `AutoDutyIPC = new()` init; matching unsubscribe in `Dispose()`.

### Notes
- Still default-OFF. Enable under Main UI Options > Hold to Repeat.
- The 350ms gate is set wider than a frame interval but tighter than half a GCD, which catches every game-side queue refresh while held but releases promptly on let-go.

## v1.0.4.15 (2026-05-18)

### Fixed
- **Install/Update failure (CRITICAL)**: `pluginmaster.json` advertised AssemblyVersion 1.0.4.14 but the bundled `GluttonyCombo.json` inside `latest.zip` reported 1.0.4.12 - the csproj `<Version>` was never bumped in v1.0.4.13 / v1.0.4.14. Dalamud rejected the install with a manifest mismatch and silently uninstalled the plugin on attempted update. csproj `<Version>` is now `1.0.4.15` and `pluginmaster.json` matches.
- **AutoDuty IPC integration (was a no-op)**: `Services/IPC_Subscriber/AutoDuty.cs` subscribed to `AutoDuty.isRunning` / `AutoDuty.isPaused` / `AutoDuty.currentState` - none of which AutoDuty exports. Every call threw, `SafeInvoke` swallowed the error, `ShouldYield` was `false` forever, and the targeting-loop fix from v1.0.4.13 never actually engaged. Rewritten using the project's `ReusableIPC` pattern with the correct PascalCase IPC names (`AutoDuty.IsStopped`, `AutoDuty.IsNavigating`); `ShouldYield` is now `IsEnabled && !IsStopped` so Gluttony yields rotation + targeting whenever AutoDuty has the wheel.
- **Hold-to-Repeat runaway**: the v1.0.4.13 gate was `TimeSinceLastAction < 1500ms`, which would self-perpetuate (each plugin re-fire resets the timer) and could spam an action indefinitely. Tightened the window to 400ms and added a 2600ms self-cooldown so at most one assist fire per GCD cycle, with hard stop the moment the user stops feeding fresh button presses.

### Notes
- Hold-to-Repeat remains disabled by default and is still time-based; a future revision will hook `UseActionDetour` for true button-state detection.

## v1.0.4.14 (2026-05-18)

### Added
- **Hold to Repeat**: New toggleable option (Main UI Options > Hold to Repeat) that continuously fires your last combo-replaced action while you hold the hotbar button. Automatically respects GCD, animation lock, and casting state. Stops immediately when you release the button.

## v1.0.4.13 (2026-05-18)

### Fixed
- **AutoDuty IPC Integration**: Added AutoDuty IPC subscriber to detect when AutoDuty has paused for mechanics (Pyretic, Untarget, etc.). Gluttony now yields autorotation and target acquisition when AutoDuty is in control, preventing the targeting loop where AutoDuty clears the target and Gluttony immediately retargets.
  - New file: `GluttonyCombo/Services/IPC_Subscriber/AutoDuty.cs`
  - Patched: `GluttonyCombo/GluttonyCombo.cs` Ã¢â‚¬â€ initializes and disposes AutoDuty IPC
  - Patched: `GluttonyCombo/AutoRotation/AutoRotationController.cs` Ã¢â‚¬â€ checks `AutoDutyIPC.ShouldYield` in `ShouldSkipAutorotation()`
